 A terrible music player made in Electron because fuck you, that's why.  
If you don't believe it's terrible, go look at the source code or even build it for yourself or download a built version if I ever get round to that. It really is dogshit.   
If you really want to make it better, go ahead - fork it and create a pull request. But trust me, it's not worth your time.
